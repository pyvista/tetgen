This Python module is an interface to Hang Si's
`TetGen <https://github.com/ufz/tetgen>`__ C++ software.
This module combines speed of C++ with the portability and ease of installation
of Python along with integration to `PyVista <https://docs.pyvista.org>`_ for
3D visualization and analysis.
See the `TetGen <https://github.com/ufz/tetgen>`__ GitHub page for more details
on the original creator.

This python module uses the C++ source from TetGen (version 1.5.1,
released on August 18, 2018) hosted at `ufz/TetGen <https://github.com/ufz/tetgen>`__.

Brief description from
`Weierstrass Institute Software <http://wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1>`__:

    TetGen is a program to generate tetrahedral meshes of any 3D polyhedral domains.
    TetGen generates exact constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization, boundary
    conforming Delaunay meshes, and Voronoi partitions.

    TetGen provides various features to generate good quality and adaptive
    tetrahedral meshes suitable for numerical methods, such as finite element or
    finite volume methods. For more information of TetGen, please take a look at a
    list of `features <http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/features.html>`__.


Installation
------------

From `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tetgen>`__

.. code:: bash

    pip install tetgen

From source at `GitHub <https://github.com/pyvista/tetgen>`__

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/pyvista/tetgen
    cd tetgen
    pip install -r requirements_build.txt
    pip install .


Basic Example
-------------
The features of the C++ TetGen software implemented in this module are
primarily focused on the tetrahedralization a manifold triangular
surface.  This basic example demonstrates how to tetrahedralize a
manifold surface and plot part of the mesh.

.. code:: python

    import pyvista as pv
    import tetgen
    import numpy as np
    pv.set_plot_theme('document')

    sphere = pv.Sphere()
    tet = tetgen.TetGen(sphere)
    tet.tetrahedralize(order=1, mindihedral=20, minratio=1.5)
    grid = tet.grid
    grid.plot(show_edges=True)

    Tetrahedralized Sphere

Extract a portion of the sphere's tetrahedral mesh below the xy plane and plot
the mesh quality.

.. code:: python

    # get cell centroids
    cells = grid.cells.reshape(-1, 5)[:, 1:]
    cell_center = grid.points[cells].mean(1)

    # extract cells below the 0 xy plane
    mask = cell_center[:, 2] < 0
    cell_ind = mask.nonzero()[0]
    subgrid = grid.extract_cells(cell_ind)

    # advanced plotting
    plotter = pv.Plotter()
    plotter.add_mesh(subgrid, 'lightgrey', lighting=True, show_edges=True)
    plotter.add_mesh(sphere, 'r', 'wireframe')
    plotter.add_legend([[' Input Mesh ', 'r'],
                        [' Tesselated Mesh ', 'black']])
    plotter.show()

Here is the cell quality as computed according to the scaled jacobian.  This example uses the ansys.mapdl.reader library to compute the quality.

.. code::

   Compute cell quality

   >>> from ansys.mapdl.reader import quality
   >>> cell_qual = quality(subgrid)

   Plot quality

   >>> subgrid.plot(scalars=cell_qual, stitle='Quality', cmap='bwr', clim=[0, 1],
   ...              flip_scalars=True, show_edges=True)
